# Library Management System

Library Management System built with **FastAPI**, **SQLAlchemy**, and **PostgreSQL**.  
This app provides robust API for managing books and members, borrowing/returning books, and includes custom exception handling, pagination and search.

---

## Architecture: Domain-Driven Design

This project is structured according to **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**:

- **Domain Layer (`domain/`)**: Contains core business logic and entities (`Book`, `Member`).
- **Application Layer (`application/`)**: Implements use cases and orchestrates domain logic (`BookService`, `MemberService`).
- **Infrastructure Layer (`infrastructure/`)**: Handles database models, repositories, and mappers for persistence.
- **API Layer (`routers/`)**: Exposes RESTful endpoints using FastAPI, handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **Shared Layer (`shared/`)**: Defines common schemas and custom exceptions for consistent error handling.

---

## Features

- **Book Management:** Create, read, update, delete, search, and paginate books.
- **Member Management:** Register, update, and remove library members.
- **Borrow/Return:** Borrow and return books with proper validation.
- **Custom Exceptions:** Clear error responses for not found, already borrowed, and other business rules.
- **PostgreSQL Support:** Uses SQLAlchemy ORM with PostgreSQL.
- **Automatic API docs:** Swagger UI and ReDoc available out of the box.

##  Setup & Installation

### ðŸ”§ Option 1: Run with Docker (Recommended)

#### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/library-management-system.git
cd library-management-system
```

#### 2. Run the app and database
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

#### 3. Access the API Docs
- Swagger UI: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
- ReDoc: [http://localhost:8000/redoc](http://localhost:8000/redoc)

> The app will automatically run Alembic migrations and start FastAPI.

#### 4. Stopping the App
```bash
docker compose down
```

To also wipe the Postgres data:
```bash
docker compose down -v
```

---

### ðŸ§ª Option 2: Run Locally with Virtual Environment

#### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/library-management-system.git
cd library-management-system
```

#### 2. Create a virtual environment and activate it
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Set up PostgreSQL manually
Create a database:
```bash
psql -U postgres

# inside psql
CREATE DATABASE library_db;
CREATE USER library_user WITH PASSWORD 'postgres';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE library_db TO library_user;
\q
```

### 5. Update `.env` with local database URL
If you're running the app locally (without Docker), update your `.env` file to point to your local PostgreSQL instance:

#### 6. Run Alembic migrations
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

#### 7. Start FastAPI
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
